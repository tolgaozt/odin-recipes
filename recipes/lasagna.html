                <ol>
                    <li>Mix tomato paste with 1 cup sour cream; 1/4 cup dressing; and 1-1/2 tsp. each garlic powder, coriander and cumin until blended. Pour over chicken in shallow dish; turn to evenly coat both sides of each thigh with sour cream mixture. Refrigerate 3 hours to marinate.</li>
                    <li>Heat oven to 400°F. Cover rimmed baking sheet with foil; spray with cooking spray. Place 2 large skewers, parallel to each other and 1-1/2 inches apart, on prepared baking sheet. Repeat with 2 additional skewers.</li>
                    <li>Remove chicken from marinade; discard marinade. Fold chicken thighs in half, then thread evenly onto skewers, tightly threading half the thighs onto each set of parallel skewers.</li>
                    <li>Drizzle with 2 Tbsp. of the remaining dressing.</li>
                    <li>Bake 30 to 35 min. or until chicken is done (165°F). Remove chicken from oven. Heat broiler.</li>
                    <li>Broil chicken, 4 inches from heat, 5 min. on each side or until golden brown on both sides. Meanwhile, mix remaining sour cream, dressing and seasonings until blended. Reserve for later use.</li>
                    <li>Stand 1 kebab on work surface, then use sharp knife to cut chicken vertically, from top to bottom, into thin strips.</li>
                    <li>Stack pita breads on microwaveable plate; cover with damp paper towel. Microwave on HIGH 30 sec.</li>
                    <li>Spread pita breads with hummus; top with lettuce, tomatoes, cheese and chicken. Drizzle with reserved sour cream mixture; roll up.</li>
                </ol>
                <br />
                <h3><u>Now to the Cheese Sauce!</u></h3>
                <br />
                <ol>
                    <li>Melt butter in a large saucepan over a medium-low heat.</li>
                    <li>Add flour and cook, stirring, for 3-5 minutes (don’t let it brown).</li>
                    <li>Remove from heat and slowly add all the warmed milk in a thin stream, whisking all the time, until smooth.</li>
                    <li>Return to heat and cook, stirring, until thickened.</li>
