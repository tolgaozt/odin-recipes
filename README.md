This exercize seemed pretty easy except I still couldn't give my webpages a style that I liked.

This makes me realize how little I know, even though I've already built many complete website. I thought because I could build a website in React or using Chakra UI, I'd be feeling at ease when it comes to simple HTML & CSS. 

Truth is, I am a noob in programming, and even though I have enough knowledge to follow tutorials from youtube or some blogs, I'm still unable to build on my own. 

This is the main reason why I decided to take on this journey of learning a real curriculum through The Odin Project. 

I tried to go a little overkill on this one, doing my best to add some styling the exercize didn't really ask from me. But I'm happy to see I still have lots to learn.
